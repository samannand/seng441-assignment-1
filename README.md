# SENG441 Assignment 1: ArduinoML

Authors: Sam Annand (sga111), Jack Orchard (jto165)  

This README file serves to explain the use of an Arduino modelling language created with JetBrains' MPS software.

## Repository File and Folder Descriptions

In folder that this README file belongs to you will find:  
- instructions.pdf  
The PDF document that contained the intrsuctions for this assignment
- .gitignore  
A file used by git to ignore generated files and cached files
- /Presentation  
A directory containing files from our presentation to the class about this modelling language
- /ArduinoML
The MPS project directory. This directory does not present anything meaningful until opened with MPS. Once opened with MPS, you will see:  
    - ArduinoML.sandbox/ArduinoML/sandbox  
    Example applications and sandbox testing area
    - ArduinoML
        - structure
        - editor
        - constraints
        - behavior
        - typesystem
        - textgen

- /Examples  
This README contains one commented, minimum, working example as per the instructions PDF file, however this Examples directory contains some more commented working example models / applications

## Arduino Configuration

There is no required configuration for the Arduino for you to begin writing your own programs using this modelling language, however, if you would like to run our working examples, your Arduino should be set up exactly as set up in the first lab of SENG441. The setup guide from the lab can be found on page 7 of the lab PDF, or listed below: 
- An Arduino UNO with links to 3.3V and GND bays
- An LED to digital pin 13 through 1K resistor and short pin to GND bay
- A push button to digital pin 10 with 10K resistor linked to power bay and oppposite to GND
- A 4x7 segment display with A -> G connected to digital pins 1 -> 7, and D1 and D2 connected through digital pins 8 and 9 respectively
